## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.


## Index.html
The file is based on the starter code provided by udacity. At the begining there is  the code regarding the navigation bar. The rest of the code is composed of 4 sections.

## App.js 
This includes code to fill the navigation bar dynamically with the required sections. There is also code to scroll down smoothly to the desired section when clicked on in the navigation bar.
Another part of the code is concerned with actively showing the active section during the process of scrolling downwards and upwards. 
 
## styles.css
This is based on the started code provided by udacity. I altered some colors and layouts.
